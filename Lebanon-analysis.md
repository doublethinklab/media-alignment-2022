# Jordan Analysis

With thanks to Jad Melki for contributing to our analyses of Lebanon.

The following analysis is most likely limited by the fact that our aligned and
opposed phrases are over-optimized for English.

Our sense is that the amount of data and the over-optimization of the phrase
lists for English has lead to very few insights into the media in Jordan.

## Topics

The relative attention give to each topic per media is:

![Topics per Media Lebanon](/topic_coverage/Lebanon-per_media.jpg?raw=true "Topics per Media Lebanon")

Similar to other Arabic-speaking countries in our analysis, the China topic stands out quite far from the others.
Similar to Jordan, Taiwan is the second most frequently seen topic.

## Hong Kong

The Hong Kong topic is interesting as it sees just a single aligned phrase hit.

Lebanon has been experiencing a significant uprising since late 2019, and roughly half the media in the country have supported the protestors, while the other half opposed it.
Local politics may partly explain a reluctance to take a position in alignment with the PRC.
However, more work is needed to investigate this possibility.

## China

The pattern of attention to these phrases is quite similar to other countries, consistent with quoting PRC official sources.

## Taiwan

Lebanon does not particularly stand out in its overall patterns of attention given to our list of Taiwan-related phrases.

However, it does lead in use of the phrase `island of Taiwan`.

[This article](https://www.elnashra.com/news/show/1537758/%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%A8%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AC-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%91%D8%A9%D8%9F) in particular is an opinion piece that does indeed make this word choice, and does not quote it.

It is unclear given the amount of data we have whether one media or another has a particular preference for this phrase.

## Huawei/TikTok

Coverage of Huawei/TikTok sees the phrase `new Cold War` receive attention in framing events.

Compared to other Arabic speaking countries, Lebanon sees this phrase used more often in this context, however still less than English, Spanish, and Italian media.

## Xinjiang

Lebanon is the only country along with UK and India to see use of the phrase `concentration camp in Xinjiang`.

## Future Work

As for the other Arabic-speaking countries in our analysis, we need to start from textual analysis in Arabic to identify both the topics and phrases that are most salient in these linguistic contexts.
