# Egypt Analysis

The following analysis is most likely limited by the fact that our aligned and
opposed phrases are over-optimized for English.

## Topics

The relative attention give to each topic per media is:

![Topics per Media Egypt](/topic_coverage/Egypt-per_media.jpg?raw=true "Topics per Media Egypt")

An interesting observation, consistent across all Arabic-speaking countries studied,
is that the volume of coverage of the general China topic greatly outweighs
the amount of coverage of the other topics in our set.

Another observation is that alwafd and elbalad stand out as offering quite a bit more
coverage of these other topics than other media in Egypt.

However, Taiwan consistently stands out as the second most popular topic in Egypt.

## China

Within this topic, the most aligned phrases are `anti-China`, `Cold War mentality`, and `China's domestic affairs`.

![Egypt China](/country_topic_phrases/Egypt-China.jpg?raw=true "Egypt China")

Egypt is among the leaders in giving attention to the phrase `China's domestic affairs`.

![China's domestic affairs](/country_phrase_comparison/China's%20domestic%20affairs.jpg?raw=true "China's domestic affairs")

The media almasryalyoum leads Egypt in giving attention to both `China's domestic affairs` and `Cold War mentality`.

![Egypt China's domestic affairs](/media_phrase_comparison/Egypt/China's%20domestic%20affairs.jpg?raw=true "Egypt China's domestic affairs")
![Egypt Cold War mentality](/media_phrase_comparison/Egypt/Cold%20War%20mentality.jpg?raw=true "Egypt Cold War mentality")

Hits on `China's domestic affairs` include [this article](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/2408142) which is a lengthy opinion piece giving a lot of space to PRC messaging.

## Taiwan

Egypt and Spain are the two countries who use the phrase `Taiwan, China` the most.

![Taiwan, China](/country_phrase_comparison/Taiwan,%20China.jpg?raw=true "Taiwan, China")

Within Egypt, the media who use this phrase are youm7, elmogaz, albawabhnews, and once again almasryalyoum.

![Egypt Taiwan, China](/media_phrase_comparison/Egypt/Taiwan,%20China.jpg?raw=true "Egypt Taiwan, China")

Focusing on almasryalyoum, [these](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/2473855) [two](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/2483812) articles are both entirely one-sided presentations of the CCP's position on Taiwan with a number of aligned phrases and no counterpoint or criticism.
We have a strong indication that almasryalyoum is aligned to the CCP on Taiwan.

## Hong Kong

The phrase hits suggest that media in Egypt do use the phrase `pro-democracy` about Hong Kong, as well as a number of aligned phrases.

![Egypt Hong Kong](/country_topic_phrases/Egypt-Hong%20Kong.jpg?raw=true "Egypt Hong Kong")

However, Egypt also has the lowest rate of using the phrase `pro-democracy` in document classified as related to Hong Kong.

![pro-democracy](/country_phrase_comparison/pro-democracy.jpg?raw=true "pro-democracy")

We note that almasryalyoum does not use this phrase in 23 articles about Hong Kong in our sample.
This is a conspicuous absence.
Of the phrases in our set, the most hits are aligned phrases suggesting that Hong Kong matters are the PRC's internal affairs.
