# UK Analysis

## Topics

The relative attention give to each topic per media is:

![Topics per Media UK](/topic_coverage/UK-per_media.jpg?raw=true "Topics per Media UK")

Other than our catch-all, general China topic, in our sampling period the UK
media appear most interested in the Xinjiang topic. Sky appears to have relatively
little interest in Taiwan, although relatively interested in Hong Kong.

## Xinjiang

We therefore start by looking at the Xinjiang topic.

![UK Xinjiang](/country_topic_phrases/UK-Xinjiang.jpg?raw=true "UK Xinjiang")

As expected, the UK media overall are not shy about reporting on human rights
abuses in Xinjiang. One finding, which we will return to for UK, is that there
is a relatively high usage rate of the phrase `anti-China` in virtually every
topic. The phrases `alleged human rights abuses` and `religious extremism` are
also highly featured aligned phrases in the UK, both appearing nearing 40 times.

As expected, a random sample of these documents indicates that most  
(likely) [indirect quotes](https://news.sky.com/story/winter-olympics-2022-china-warns-uk-us-and-australia-will-pay-the-price-for-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-games-12490517),
but [not all](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57830856).
The choice of this phrase could be considered an attempt to appear editorially neutral, 
however, at this point in time, we argue that the weight of evidence of crimes
against humanity in Xinjiang makes this word choice less rather than more neutral.
The BBC appears to stand out as the most likely to make this editorial decision.

A random sample of the appearances of `religious extremism` appear to be attempts
at editorial balance, [indirectly](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-10476893/Olympics-Putin-Xi-mix-politics-sport-unveiling-alliance-Olympics.html) quoting PRC officials.
Daily Mail and The Independent are most likely to make this editorial choice.

![UK religious extremism](/media_phrase_comparison/UK/religious%20extremism.jpg?raw=true "UK religious extremism")

The Independent is an interesting case in light of the publication’s ownership 
and a November 18, 2021 deal to begin publishing the China Daily-issued 
“China Watch” articles.
Although this is a clear vector of PRC influence, our data does not yet paint a 
clear picture of patterns of over-alignment and under-opposition at The Independent.
They are not shy about using opposed phrases, and, overall, their patterns
os using our aligned phrases are not noticeably out-of-step with the rest of the 
UK media studied.

The Daily Mail's preference for the term `religious extremism` may or may not
extend from their well-known preference for xenophobia. We argue that 
distracting from the horrific human rights abuses 
occuring in Xinjiang by giving undue attention to the CCP's 
preferred framing of their actions as countering "terrorism" and "religious extremism" is a 
terrible editorial decision.

## Hong Kong

The topic with the second highest attention in UK is Hong Kong.

![UK Hong Kong](/country_topic_phrases/UK-Hong%20Kong.jpg?raw=true "UK Hong Kong")

As expected, the UK media shows significant editorial balance in reporting on
Hong Kong issues, and does not shy away from CCP-opposed framings of protests
as relating to democracy issues. On the opposed side, we once again see `anti-China`
sticking out. 

## China

This is also very apparent in our catch-all "China" topic.

![UK China](/country_topic_phrases/UK-China.jpg?raw=true "UK China")

The Independent leads in preference for attention given to the phrase
`new Cold War`.

![UK new Cold War](/media_phrase_comparison/UK/new%20Cold%20War.jpg?raw=true "UK new Cold War")

Notably, this term appears in [opinion](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/culture-wars-boris-johnson-threat-to-uk-b1885436.html), 
not as quotes, in the Independent.
This may or may not be ideological alignment between the CCP and The Independent.

The BBC has the lead on using the phrase `Cold War mentality`.

![UK Cold War mentality](/media_phrase_comparison/UK/Cold%20War%20mentality.jpg?raw=true "UK Cold War mentality")

However, this is largely accounted for by [quoting PRC officials](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58610234).

This brings us to `anti-China`. By quite a margin, the Daily Mail leads in
the use of this phrase.

![UK anti-China](/media_phrase_comparison/UK/anti-China.jpg?raw=true "UK anti-China")

This likely somewhat accounts for the large lead the UK has over the other
countries studied in the average use of this phrase, but not entirely.

![anti-China](/country_phrase_comparison/anti-China.jpg?raw=true "anti-China")

We see that the Guardian is above the mean of the second place country, India, 
and that The Independent and BBC are both well above all other countries in our
sample.

We believe this is a significant finding and one that requires serious thought.
The label `anti-China` is not often self-given and is a thought-terminating cliche
often thrown as a smear.
A recent topical example in the English language media sphere comes from 
Australia, where the [Australian Financial Review](https://twitter.com/drewpavlou/status/1520952101408440320?s=21&t=HXPSs33VyjNAVlb2aRQ96A) (considered to be more
PRC-aligned in Australia due to cognitive capture of Australia's business elites)
labeled self-identifying pro-China, anti-CCP activist Drew Pavlou as "anti-China."
This label plays into the hands of CCP propaganda by equating the CCP with "China,"
and therefore criticism of the CCP as criticism of China, and even, to some minds,
as *racist*.
Needless to say, this label is also opposed by some [Chinese Australians](https://twitter.com/badiucao/status/1520999889492406273?s=21&t=HXPSs33VyjNAVlb2aRQ96A).

## Taiwan

We find that the most common CCP-aligned phrase about Taiwan in the UK media
is "reunification/reunify."

![UK Taiwan](/country_topic_phrases/UK-Taiwan.jpg?raw=true "UK Taiwan")

As our [guide](https://github.com/doublethinklab/media-alignment-2022/blob/main/phrase_guide.md) states,
this framing incorrectly assumes that the unification of Taiwan and the PRC was true at some
point in the past and is therefore aligned to CCP messaging.

This finding suggests that editors in the UK media should consider not using this
term when paraphrasing. If using direct quotes, the questionable assumption the 
term presupposes should be made clear to the reader.

We similarly find that the most CCP-opposed phrase is "Taiwanese". As our 
[guide](https://github.com/doublethinklab/media-alignment-2022/blob/main/phrase_guide.md) shows,
this is a term the CCP is keen to stamp out, particularly when referring to the
Taiwanese people, language, or government. The term does however appear in the
PRC state media, usually referring to companies or other organizations.

## Huawei / TikTok

We find that `anti-China` once again dominates aligned phrases in this topic.
