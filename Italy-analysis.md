# Italy Analysis

The following analysis is most likely limited by the fact that our aligned and
opposed phrases are over-optimized for English.

## Topics

The relative attention give to each topic per media is:

![Topics per Media Italy](/topic_coverage/Italy-per_media.jpg?raw=true "Topics per Media Italy")

The general China topic is (as expected) has the most volume.
The next most popular topic is Hong Kong, followed by Taiwan.
Xinjiang is of relatively less interest to the Italian media.

## Hong Kong

![Italy Hong Kong](/country_topic_phrases/Italy-Hong%20Kong.jpg?raw=true "Italy Hong Kong")

The Italian media does not appear to go against the characterization of protests as relating to democratic demands.

![pro-democracy](/country_phrase_comparison/pro-democracy.jpg?raw=true "pro-democracy")

However, they are, with the UK, the most likely to use the phrase "Cold War mentality".

![Cold War mentality](/country_phrase_comparison/Cold%20War%20mentality.jpg?raw=true "Cold War mentality")

Similar to the BBC, this appears to be largely due to [quoting PRC officials](https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/mondo/pechino-2022-gli-usa-annunciano-il-boicottaggio-diplomatico-la-cina-una-farsa-politica_42719025-202102k.shtml).
[This article](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2021/12/07/tensioni-usa-cina-pechino-replica-a-biden-paghera-per-il-boicottaggio-delle-olimpiadi-e-violazione-della-neutralita-politica-nello-sport/6417884/), however, appears to strike a tone of agreement with official PRC views, stating that the US diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics is "damaging to dialogue."
Il Fatto Quotidiano is a newspaper close to the 5Stars Movement. This may be interesting because the 5Stars Movement was, together with North League, the political party behind the MoU between Italian and Chinese government signed in March 2019, through which Italy officially joined the BRI. 
This finding appears to be consistent with ideological alignment with the CCP.

ANSA see a hit on the term `order in Hong Kong`, which comes from [this article](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/mondo/2021/12/30/hong-kong-accusa-di-sedizione-per-2-arrestati-stand-news_cfa6a7b9-62f7-4e22-bfa1-6a1d04ab0203.html), appearing to be a PRC state media press release, attributed to "ANSA editorial staff" in Beijing, that presents the CCP's side of the arrest of journalists without criticism or counterpoint.

## Xinjiang

![Italy Taiwan](/country_topic_phrases/Italy-Xinjiang.jpg?raw=true "Italy Xinjiang")

What is notable is the absence of most of our opposed phrases, which you would expect to see if the Italian media were covering this issue properly.
For example, `ongoing genocide` appears in the media of 5/7 countries other than Italy (with Jordan and Lebanon not seeing this phrase). 

![ongoing genocide](/country_phrase_comparison/ongoing%20genocide.jpg?raw=true "ongoing genocide")

In our sample, which covers a relatively short time frame, it is possible that Xinjiang and Hong Kong were treated by the Italian media as less worthy of attention, more of side issues to the Winter Olympics.

Another potentially interesting finding is that tgcom24, a right-wing newspaper, is the only media outlet to use the phrase `alleged human rights abuses`.
Upon further analysis, this may turn out not be alignment as much as xenophobia.

## Taiwan

Although the Taiwan topic receives relatively little attention according to the topic counts, it has the largest breadth of phrase hits of any topic.

![Italy Taiwan](/country_topic_phrases/Italy-Taiwan.jpg?raw=true "Italy Taiwan")

Similar to the [UK](https://github.com/doublethinklab/media-alignment-2022/blob/main/UK-analysis.md), we see a strong preference for using the phrase `reunification`.

![Italy reunification](/media_phrase_comparison/Italy/reunification.jpg?raw=true "Italy reunification")

ANSA are of particular interest for alignment analysis due to their republication of PRC state media.
[This article](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/mondo/asia/2021/12/29/cina-misure-drastiche-se-taiwan-verso-indipendenza_e627e93c-808f-42cd-957f-0b2904e4f62a.html), for example, reads like an unattributed PRC press release, although it is attributed to the ANSA editors.
The same goes for [this article](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/topnews/2021/11/16/xi-la-riunificazione-di-taiwan-e-missione-storica-del-pcc_11c62af7-d2a9-4916-98ac-bec56f79ef5e.html), which also fails to provide any context, counterpoint, or critical analysis of CCP messaging.
ANSA appear to be in alignment with the CCP position on Taiwan and Hong Kong.

## Future Work

The Italian media landscape deserves further analysis.
We should commence from textual analysis in Italian.
We should also cover topics such as BRI more deeply, following the results of [prior work](https://www.iai.it/it/pubblicazioni/one-belt-one-voice-i-media-cinesi-italia).
