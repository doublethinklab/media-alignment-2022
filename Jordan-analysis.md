# Jordan Analysis

The following analysis is most likely limited by the fact that our aligned and
opposed phrases are over-optimized for English.

Our sense is that the amount of data and the over-optimization of the phrase
lists for English has lead to very few insights into the media in Jordan.

## Topics

The relative attention give to each topic per media is:

An interesting observation, consistent across all Arabic-speaking countries studied,
is that the volume of coverage of the general China topic greatly outweighs
the amount of coverage of the other topics in our set.

Jordan is similar to Lebanon in that Taiwan is the second-largest topic,
followed by Huawei/TikTok, then Xinjiang.

## China

The China topic sees the phrases `Cold War mentality` and `China's domestic affairs`, which are expected from quoting PRC state media.

## Taiwan

Along with other Arabic-speaking media, referring to [Taiwanese](https://www.ammonnews.net/article/628049) as `Taiwanese` frequently occurs.

## Hong Kong

Media in Jordan are also quite unlikely to use the term `pro-democracy` in articles about Hong Kong compared to other countries.

## Huawei/TikTok

We only have hits for opposed phrases.

At this stage we are unable to determine whether this is an artifact of our data sample and phrase lists.

## Future Work

As for the other Arabic-speaking countries in our analysis, we need to start from textual analysis in Arabic to identify both the topics and phrases that are most salient in these linguistic contexts.
