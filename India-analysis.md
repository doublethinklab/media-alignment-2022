# India Analysis

## Commentary

On stories that don’t impact India’s geo-strategic or sovereign interests, (i.e. Taiwan)
a certain hesitation from providing in depth analysis of a particular concern appears as a
striking commonality across prominent Indian media channels like Hindustan Times,
Economic Times, Indian Express, among others. It seems as if it is left to the reader to analyse
and at times, stating the obvious is also omitted. For example, coverage of issues ranging from
China’s provocations in Taiwanese airspace to its diplomatic influence globally tend to baldly
state the facts of the case as they are understood, and rarely make efforts at deeper analysis.

The use of China “aligned” phrases
typically tend to come only from direct or paraphrasing and are used in the context of a
Chinese response to particular allegations made against them. The same is not true of China
“opposed” phrases. This creates the compounded impression that opposition to China’s
position is grounded in neutral analysis while a defence of Chinese viewpoints typically comes
from a spokesperson’s quote. Therefore it can be understood that such an approach creates an
increased, favourable bias towards issues relating to Taiwan, the Uyghurs, the Russia-China
alliance, the sexual assault case, China’s authoritarianism resulting in the restriction of Hong
Kong’s autonomy (especially the security law), among others.

In general, judging the relative attention paid to PRC narratives in India’s media through this
project is difficult for two reasons. Firstly, the relative importance of news stories is difficult
to judge in digital media, which make up the vast majority of the articles surveyed as part of
this project. While the placement of articles in the print media says much about the relative
importance of the story, the same cannot be said for digital media sources. Further, given the
outsized focus on digital news sources, we cannot be certain how TV news, which has a broader
reach than digital news, has picked up and disseminated information on similar topics.

## Topics

The relative attention give to each topic per media is:

Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang, all receive significant attention in India.

## China

The China topic in India sees significant attention given to the phrase `anti-China`.

A similar pattern is seen in many countries, however India is second to the UK in attention given to this phrase.

The standout in attention to this phrase appears to be timesnownews.

Along with France, India stands out in attention given to the phrase `external interference`.
Further analysis is needed to determine whether or not this is a significant finding.

## Taiwan

India sees relatively more attention give to the phrase `territorial integrity` compared to some countries.

It is possible that this reflects Indian concerns about their own territorial integrity, given border clashes with the PRC.
The Indian media giving most attention to this phrase is hindustantimes.

However, looking at these [articles](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-air-intrusions-over-taiwan-challenges-us-military-might-in-indopacific-101633427905097.html), they are directly or indirectly quoting PRC officials, but providing criticism of their position, and cannot be said as aligned to CCP ideology. 

## Xinjiang

India is similar to the UK in leading the countries analyzed in attention give to the terms `alleged human rights abuses` as well as `sexual assault`.

![](/country_phrase_comparison/sexual%20assault.jpg?raw=true)

Focusing on `alleged human rights abuses`, an aligned phrase, we see ndtv among the leaders, as well as hindustantimes.
Given that hindustan times also gives attention to `sexual assault`, and our other observations, it is most likely that they are attempting to provide editorial balance by quoting PRC officials.
However, [this article](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/beijing-winter-olympics-uk-canada-join-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-winter-games-2643863) from ndtv could be seen as providing little more than a he-said-she-said form of balance regarding human rights violations in Xinjiang, which is inappropriate given the overwhelming evidence.
We argue that such an editorial decision is misleading to readers, presenting a matter of fact as a political issue. 

## Huawei/TikTok

Indian media give more attention to opposed phrases with respect to this topic than other countries, which may represent their own security concerns about PRC technology imports.
