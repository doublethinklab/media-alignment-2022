# Spain Analysis

The analysis of Spain is also limited by our phrase lists, and relatively short sampling window.

## Topics

The relative attention give to each topic per media is:

Taiwan receives a relatively high level attention, more than Xinjiang or Hong Kong.

## Taiwan

The phrase `reuinification` sees a great many hits, even more than `Taiwanese`.

This appears to be quite consistent across the media space (La Sexta is an outlier to be ignored):

[This article](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20220124/8007421/taiwan-denuncia-incursion-39-aviones-combate-china.html), also from La Vanguardia, claims that the PRC is "committed to peaceful reunification."
This is not a quote, and so counts as a choice to use this phrase.
In contrast, [this article](https://elpais.com/internacional/2021-10-10/taiwan-responde-a-xi-y-asegura-que-no-se-doblegara-ante-china.html) from El Pais quotes "reunification" from a PRC official, but chooses the phrase "unification" in the first paragraph when describing the situation.
Overall, it is a outstanding example of balanced and nuanced reporting on Taiwan.

Another feature that stands out in Spain's treatment of Taiwan is the high levels of attention given to `secessionist` and `separatist`.
An example is [this article](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20211117/7866984/biden-xi-dialogo-encuentro-virtual-choque-taiwan.html) from La Vanguardia, 
which gives prominence to CCP messaging about Taiwan including the phrase `secessionist`, without much counterpoint,
continuing to refer to Taiwan as `the island`.

## Hong Kong

What stands out from the raw counts is the relatively high level of attention received by `rioters`.

However, this appears to be an artifact of the relatively small data sample.
[This article](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20211229/7958290/arrestados-stand-news-macroredada-hong-kong.html) from La Vanguardia about the arrest of Stand News journalists quotes the phrase, but is very much not CCP aligned in tone and coverage.

## Xinjiang

Coverage of Xinjiang shows a range of aligned and opposed phrases, suggesting a degree of editorial balance.

Again, the counts involved are too low to draw any conclusions at this time.
